# phase-transition

In logic, phase transitions refer to the phenomenon whereby randonly generated clauses flip from satisfiable to unsatisfiable. It is known that the likelihood for this change in state increases the longer the clause is.

This script tries to leverage the Boxer semantic parser to extract logic meaning representations from increasingly longer sentence detected in corpora, and to check for the (un)satisfiability using a resolution theorem prover (SPASS).
